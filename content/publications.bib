  abstract = {To reduce computational performance requirements and improve the nonlinear representation ability of neural networks as well as the accuracy of solving soliton solutions of partial differential equations, this paper utilizes a deep learning framework to design physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) containing adaptive nonlinear combined activation functions. By embedding physical information from mathematical physics models into the network via generalized approximation capabilities, the proposed PINNs achieve high-accuracy analytical solutions for partial differential equations. Experimental validation on the (1+1)-dimensional Burgers equation, (1+1)-dimensional Schrödinger equation, and (2+1)-dimensional Navier–Stokes equation demonstrates superior prediction performance in capturing intricate spatio-temporal dynamics. Application to four soliton solutions of the Burgers equation confirms the method's effectiveness in reducing computational complexity while maintaining solution accuracy.},
